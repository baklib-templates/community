# Baklib Community (Question) Theme

A modern Q&A and discussion theme whose layouts are easy to map to familiar products: **Discourse**-style forum chrome (sidebar navigation, timeline), **Reddit**-style linear feeds, and **Stack Overflow**–style structured threads. Use it for knowledge bases, FAQs, technical support, and community discussions.

**Docs (ZH):** See [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md) for the Chinese readme.

**Tutorial:** [https://github.com/baklib-templates/community](https://github.com/baklib-templates/community)  

**Demo:** [https://demo-question.uibak.com/](https://demo-question.uibak.com/)

**Theme id:** `community` (`theme_name` in `config/settings_schema.json`). Renaming from a previous id may affect existing site bindings—confirm migration with your Baklib environment before deploying.

## Recent updates

**2026-07-16**

- **My community (`/s/me`):** After sign-in, the header opens My community (your posts with review badges, related threads, replies received). Account profile remains a secondary link to the org profile page.
- **Staff reply auto-publish:** Organization staff accounts (with department IDs—same heuristic as the daily post limit) always publish replies immediately, regardless of the reply review setting.
- **Review visibility:** Authors see an under-review banner on their own unpublished posts; My community lists review badges; the new-post form points users to My community for status.

**2026-06-26**

- **Comment moderation (independent from posts):** In theme settings you can choose publish-first or review-first for **replies**, separately from **posts**. Enabled by default: replies appear immediately after submission; when disabled, staff must approve replies before they show on the site.

## Stack

- Liquid templates  
- Tailwind CSS + Stimulus + Turbo

---

## Getting started

1. Install the theme in Baklib and create a site.
2. Configure appearance: logo, default avatar, **post/reply moderation**, feedback emoji, copyright, header/footer HTML.
3. Define **collection tags** and **feature tags** under theme settings if you use those facets.
4. Set **home** and **topic** templates to either Reddit-style or Discourse-style variants.
5. Optional: open `/s/about` (link it from **Settings → header menu**, e.g. `About[/s/about`) for operator-facing copy.

User-visible strings are centralized under `locales/` (`zh-CN`, `en`, `de`, `fr`, `ja`). Editor labels for this theme use `t:settings_schema.community*` and `t:settings_schema.community_templates*` keys in the `*.schema.json` files. Theme seeds default to English (`seeds/`).
